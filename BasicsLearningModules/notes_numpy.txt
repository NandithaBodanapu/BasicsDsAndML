Numpy notes
scalar operation: operations on single value
vector operations: operation on collection of values
vectorized operations are faster and numpy  uses vectorized operations
Arrays vs List

List:
-does not let you do vectorized operations
-different datatypes in same list
-can increase or decrease size once created
Arrays:
-allows vectorized operations
-data type must be same for all values
-cannot change size once created
-occupies less space compared to list

Array attributes:
dimensions -1d,2d,3d,
shape-size of each dimention
size-number of elements in an array
data type-int , float etc
itemsize-size in bytes  of each element
nbytes-total size of array

Reshaping of arrrays
- changing the look of array but number of elements remain same
example 2X3 matrix is rehaped to 3X2 matrix with all the elements as it is
    2X3      3X2
  [0 1]    [0 2 4]
  [2,3]    [1 3 5]
  [4,5]

Horizontal and Vertical Split
Lines
Horizontal line -> -- (paralled to x axis)
Vertical line -> | (parallel to y axis)

Axis
Horizontal Axis= Columns  # 1 axis
Vertical Axis = Rows #0 axis
So,
Horizontal_split -> (left_split , right_split)
Vertical_split -> (top_split,bottom_split)

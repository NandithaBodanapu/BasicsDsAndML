Statistics Basics
Mean- sum of elements/number of elements

Median- arange in ascending order ,
    if odd-the middle value
    if even - sum of middle values /2

Standard Deviation:
- high standard deviation means data is spreadout
arr[ar1,ar2,ar3], n=3
1- calculate mean ar1+ar2+ar3/3
2-calculate variance ->(sum of squares of ( mean -each value )) /3 # high variance = the data poins are scattered
3-standard deviaton=(variance)^(1/2)

Correlation coefficient
-relationship between two values
-how one value influences the other
For two sets A,B if the corelation coefficient is
1 - the two sets A,B are related well
0 - no relation exists
-1 -negative corelation , A inversly affects B

Causation - just because the numerical value of corelation is 1, does not mean they have a good relation
example eating food ->gaining weight (can have a positve corealtion)
example position of moon->gaining weight (can generate positive corelation, but has no influence) hencd causation


BAYESIAN STATISTICS
bayes theorem:
probability as - a degree of belief

P(A|B)=(P(A) *P(B|A))/P(B)
Where,
p(A)-probability of event x on its own
p(B)-probability of event y on its own
p(B|A)-how often B happens given that A already happend
Example:

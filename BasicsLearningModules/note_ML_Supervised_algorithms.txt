Linear Regression
- as name suggest - continuous outputs
-y = mx+c
- tries to fit the the relationship of data along a line, we can predict the values based on the line
x= one(simple linear regression) or more(multiple linear regression) independent variables
y=dependent variable
m=slope
- we should be careful to identify the optimal values of m and b
-Least squares model
-vertical distance from each datapoint to the line are minimum

Logistic regression

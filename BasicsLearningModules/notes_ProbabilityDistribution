probability gives us the percent chance of an event occuring
probability distribution  is a function that shows the probabilities of all possible values
example - incase of missing data , using the probability distribution we can replace the missing value with observed probabilities

RANDOM VARIABLES
- set of possible values from random experiment
-Discrete data
 -can only take specified values,
-tossing a coin only gives 2 outcomes heads or tails, no inter mediary outcome
- rolling a die only gives 6 outcomes, cannot get 2.3 or 4.5
-Continuouse data
- can take many values ,
1-1.2
range can be finite or infinite

probability distributions
-discerete probability distribution - discrete variables
-probability density functions- continuous function

types of distribution
- uniform distribution:
    basic probability distribution (x axis many vary)
- bernoullis distribution:
    one single trial
    discrete probability distribution
    (p,1-p)-(x axis( 0,1))
-Binomial Distribution:
    -multiple trial
    - number of trials are fixed and all trials are identical
    - 2 outcomes , (0 or 1) ( pass or fail)
    -probability of success for both the outcomes are the same
    -the outcome of one trail does not affect the other

- Normal distribution:
    - AKA bell curve, Gaussian distribution
    - mean = meadian = mode
    - 50% less than mean and the other 50% greater than mean
    -symmetrical
standardizibng the distribution using zscores
zscores=  a way to test w.r.t the mean
var x, mean -mue, variance -sigma^2
zscore=(x-mue)/sigma
converting  a normal distribution  into (mean=0, standardeviation=1)= standard normal distribution

Poisson Distribution;
probability of - given numbe of events in a fixed interval of time
- forcasting earthquakes
- number of succeses in two disjoint time interval is independent.
- probability of successes in  small time intervals  is proportional to entire length of time interval
-probability of sucess as interval aproaches zero, interval becomes smaller

Exponential Distribution:
poisson example- shoping trends
we have monitored shopping trends for a given time period using poisson, and have found days with low trends.
now using exponential distribution we can identify, the time between two low trends

flatter the curve - lower the rate of event likely to occure
the sharper the curve drops- higher the rate of occurance

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
-is a measure of weather our findings are meaningful or just a result of random chance
3 steps
1.hypothesis testing
    evaluating a theory using data
    -Null hypothesis-
        refers to commonly accepted fact, our goal is to disprove this fact

    -Alternate hypothesis
        opposite theory to null hypothesis
2.Normal distribution
-z test, hypothesis test to alternate hypothesis ,sample data is normally distributed, sample size greated thatn 30
- CLT- central limit theorem, applies when sample size is greater than 30

3.p-values
- quantifies rareness in our results
-compare p-value to a SIGNIFICANCE value (alpha)(we choose)(0.05, usually used value/ can change in certain situations)
- small p value less than significance value-numbers can rarely occur stand alone , and we can reject the null hypothesis
-large p value-accept that null hypothesis is valid

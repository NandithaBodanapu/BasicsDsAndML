#Basic steps/ practices to approach an ML project
Broader scope:
-Get data
-Clean , prepare and maniputlate the data
-Train model
-Test data
-Improvise the model
In realtime,
Before we begin the project its always nice to get an objective
- we may come across multiple meaningful insights, but may not be what the customer really wants
- its always good to ask questions and get it cleared
- keeping the task at hand , we can choose the required algorithm/model
-helps us use a visualization technique ,that can better showcase our work to the client


Going into detail
1.Exploratory data analysis
    -go through the data structure
    -try plotting the data using different attribute to gain a rough idea about the problem
    -identify the data types
    -see if there is any corelation among attributes
2.Prepare the data
 -check for missing values, and replace them appropriate values
 -check for outliers
 -corelated attributes

3.scikit learn
4.train models and assess them
5. evaluation of different models
6.cross validation
7. model visualization
8.maintain

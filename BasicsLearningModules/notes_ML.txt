Machine learning
the computer learns by itself without being programmed
>Data

>Features
- variable or parameter
- must choose meaningful features
>Algorithm
example classification
Types of Machine leaning algorithms
4 groups
- supervised Learning
-unsupervised Learning
-Semisupervised Learning
-Reinforcement Learning

Supervised Learning:
-algorithm has supervisor or teacher
-two basic types of algorithms
-choose the algorithm based on the required output
- will have labels

1.classification
 - output-yes or no (1,0)
2.regression
    -continuous outputs
    - target number prediction

Unsupervised Learning:
    - to find relationship in data
    -example image size reduction , based on clustering of the nearby pixels

Semisupervised learning
- contains few data which are labeled , and mostly non labeled data
-example , in iphone photos,
unsupervised part -it recognizes a picture of a person in two photos,
user input - label the person
supervised part- can name everyone in every photo

Reinforcement learning:
- advanced category of learning
- Learning system - refered to as Agents
1.Agents are exposed to new environments
2.Agents perform some actions
3.Agents receives rewards or penalties based on the action
4.By trails and error they learn to maximize their rewards

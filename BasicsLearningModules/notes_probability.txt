Probability
- chance that something happens
- 1 - possible
- 0 - impossible
- Toss a coin - could be head or tail
-For a coin,
Event ->tossing a coin
number of events -> one toss ->-> one outcome
total number of possible outcomes=2 (head or tail)

probability= favorable cases/ total number of outcomes
- similarly for a die
-one roll one outcome (any number from 1-6)
-total number fo outcomes = any number from (1-6) so 6
probability = 1/6

Events can be dependent or independent depenting on the situation

INDEPENDENT EVENTS:
- outcome of one does not affect the other
-P(A and B)= P(A)*P(B)
tossing a die 2 times
probability =1/2 * 1/2
rolling a die 3 times
-probability =1/6 * 1/6 *1/6

DEPENDENT EVENTS: (AND)
-outcome of one affect the other
-P(A and B)= P(A)*P(B after A occured)
Example
Deck of cards - 52 , {black -26, red 26},{spades:13,clubs:13,Diamond:13,hearts:13}
event A probability of picking a black card:
probability =total number of black cards /total number of cards = 26/52
Event B probability of picking a black card after event A, where the outcome was a black card
probability= (black cards -1)/(total cards-1)
probability=26/52 * 25/51
p(A)=26/52
p(B after A)=25/51

MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EVENTS:(OR)
- Two events cannot happen together
-example - when you toss a coin, you cannot get both (head and tails) in a single toss
P(A and B )= 0
P(A or B)= P(A) + P(B)
Example probability of getting king or queen
P(A)- probability of getting a king = 4/52
p(B)- probability of getting a queen= 4/52
p(A or B)= 4/52 +4/52
            =1/13 + 1/13
            =2/13
INCLUSIVE EVENTS:
Choosing a card from deck - probability of it  King or Heart

P(A OR B)= P(A) + P(B) - P(A AND B)
P(A)- probability of getting a king = 4/52
p(B)- probability of getting heart= 13/52
p(A and B)- probability of it being heart and king = 1/52
 p(A or B)=4/52 +13/52 -1/52
    =16/52
CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY
probability of drawing 2 kings
p(A)drawing 1 king -4/52
p(B|A)drawing secong king , assuming 1 king is already picked in the previous event-3/51

DEPENDENT EVENTS VS CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY
DEPENDENT EVENTS;
outcome of one event influence the outcome the other event
pick a red card from deck, pick another red card from the same deck without replacing the first card

CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY:
mathematical concept
- calculate the probability of the event occuring , give the other event has already occured
calculate the probability of picking a red card a second time , given you already drew a red card in first pick

- this data shows outliers
-prelimnary analysis of large data
-data skewdness
give 5 summary details

median- as the name suggest the middle value (50th percntile)
Upperquartile -above 75% of the data(75th percentile)
highest value-highest value
outliers- lies outside the min,max range(3/2 times the lower and hugher range)

Reading/Interpreting  a box plot
- small box plot - small range(data points withing small range)
-tall box plot- wide range
-median  if in the center means its a balanced data
- median to the closer to the bottom means most data points are in the lowe region
-median closer to the top means most of the datapoints are in higher range
-whiskers or (distance from 25th percentile to min)/distance from 75thpercentile to max values
-whiskers can be long or short depending on the data
-long whiskers - high variance,standard deviation
-long whiskers on one side and short on another means , there is a direction

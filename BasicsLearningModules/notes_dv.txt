Scatter plot:
- used for exploring and presenting data
allows us to explore almost 4 different dimentsion
x,y accoutn for 2 dimentions
using color we can show another dimention
using size of the scatter plot we can represent another feature

Line plot:
line plot displays data points connected by straight line segments
- relationship between datasets

Histograms:
x-axis bins ranges
y axis frequency

Bar Plots:
- works well for categorical data
- categorical data example -gender(male , female), votes(yes,no), scores_mpc(math , physics, chemisty)
- works well when we are dealing with few categories
-histogram vs bar plot
    histogram- continuous variables, frequency distribution
    bar plot-discrete variables,comparison
Box plot:
-shows the median
-shows the skewedness of data
- shows if any outliers are there
